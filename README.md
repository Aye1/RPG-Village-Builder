# Welcome to Jadrien's quest project.
Jadrien's quest is a Rogue-like 2D game, in the universe of Alice in Wonderland. Alice will travel between dreams and nightmares, in a quest to face her own fears.

##Game Design
###Gameplay
* The player can choose his/her mapping by deciding the order of the levels.
* Backtracking will be possible.
* Dream and nightmare are intrinsically linked, allowing the player to switch between the two. These modes have different objects, difficulties, features, ...
* Objects can modify Alice appearance and/or capacities.

###Story
* Each level represents a fear to fight, with his own level design.
  * The first level to be developed is the time. Alice shouldn't be late to encounter the white rabbit.
  * The other fears are still to be defined: darkness, unknown, falling...   
* Finishing a level will facilitate to progression in other levels, by the power acquired, and the features unlocked.

###Inspirations
As much as we want to do an original game with a unique user experience, we still have to rely on strong references. Our inspirations mainly come from the following games:
* [http://bindingofisaac.com/](The Binding of Isaac), for many game mechanics.
* [http://www.cellardoorgames.com/roguelegacy/](Rogue Legacy), mainly for deplacement mechanics.
* [http://store.steampowered.com/app/19680/](Alice: Madness Returns), for its dark universe.

##Current progress
### Tools
* The game is developed in the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) engine.
* The room are currently generated using [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/).
* The task management is done with [Asana](https://app.asana.com/).

### Procedural generation
* Rooms are picked randomly, according to the current level configuration, creating a whole new world at each game.
* Enemies belong to differents pools. When creating a room, enemies are randomly picked into a particular pool.
* A map and a mini map are available, to help the player navigate through the level.

###Graphism
* All characters are drawn with Photoshop, with a graphic tablet. All body parts are split to help the animations.
* Animations are either made with [Spriter](https://brashmonkey.com/spriter-features/#) or directly in Unity.
* The graphical style may be changed in the future.

###Functionalities in progress
* Inventory.
* Alice movement improvement.
